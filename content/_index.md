Welcome to the LUGStack.

What is this?  This is a collection of software and opinions on this
software that forms the stack of software that some particularly
grumpy administrators use.  We all met up as members of a particular
Linux Users Group or by being pulled into various LUG related IRC
channels.  Given that other people were far too optimistic about
software, this site was born to provide a much less optimistic view of
the software world, while still providing some ideas for what to do.
