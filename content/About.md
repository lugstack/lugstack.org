So why is this website here casting judgement upon your favorite
tools, and who are we to do so?  The idea for this project came about
one day after looking for a good solution to manage a project with,
and consulting with a small group of equivalently grumpy engineers.
Thus the idea was to catalog software that is not great, but does the
job it was designed to do.  We don't sugar coat or draw out neat
features unless they have relavance, and the point of this site is to
tell you about things you need to be aware of before picking some
program.

## Why the name?

Most of the people that write for this site were all part of the same
Linux User's Group at one time or another.  The idea is that this is
the software that we all more or less agree is okay to run in
production, in a quasi peer-reviewed way.  If you want to share your
grumpiness with us, we hang out in `#lug` on OFTC.  You don't have to
be a Linux user or system's administrator to join, but that is what we
spend most time talking about.
