The stack that runs this site is adequate, nothing more.

The domain is handled via Google Domains since they give free email
forwarding on the domain itself.

The site is run on Hugo, which has difficult to understand templating
and annoying rules around menus but doesn't require the RVM.

The source it tracked on GitHub which has tons of problems with being
a functional hosting platform, but is free and hasn't lost too much
data yet.

The end site is hosted on Netlify who keeps changing the terms of
service, but does provide functional webhook support for GitHub even
when GitHub keeps changing the webhook interface.

The TLS is provided by LetsEncrypt.
